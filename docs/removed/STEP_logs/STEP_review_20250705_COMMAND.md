# STEP_review_20250705_COMMAND.md — Backend code audit

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub is a multi-tenant ERP for fuel stations. Backend resides in `/fuelsync` using Express and Prisma with schema-per-tenant design. Prior phases implemented full backend (Phase 2) and frontend (Phase 3) with audits up to December 2025.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Backend APIs through step 2.56 with subsequent fixes
- Frontend aligned via QA audit (`QA_AUDIT_REPORT.md`)
- Prisma usage migrated in fix `2025-12-07`

## What to Build Now
Perform a comprehensive backend code review:
1. Inspect `schema.prisma` to list all models and relations.
2. Validate that architecture features (stations → pumps → nozzles → readings → sales, etc.) exist.
3. Traverse all route files to enumerate endpoints and check controller/service logic, validation and auth.
4. Flag any missing features or anti-patterns in Prisma usage.
5. Provide improvement suggestions.
Summarize findings in `docs/BACKEND_FULL_REVIEW_JUL2025.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Create `docs/BACKEND_FULL_REVIEW_JUL2025.md` with analysis.
- Append entry to `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Add row in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Update `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` with the audit reference.
