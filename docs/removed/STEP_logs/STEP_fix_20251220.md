# STEP_fix_20251220.md â€” Align CreatePumpPage with hooks

## Project Context Summary
Pump creation is now aligned with backend services on the Pumps listing page, but the dedicated Create Pump page still uses direct `pumpsApi` calls. This prevents React Query from automatically refreshing pump lists after creation.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Pump creation alignment (`STEP_fix_20251218.md`)
- Pump & Station page alignment (`STEP_fix_20251219.md`)

## What Was Done Now
- Refactored `CreatePumpPage.tsx` to use the `useCreatePump` hook.
- Added success/error handlers with toast messages and navigation.
- Removed manual API call to ensure cache invalidation updates pump lists immediately.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `fuelsync/docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`
