# STEP_fix_20251219.md â€” Pump & Station page alignment

## Project Context Summary
Previous fixes introduced contract aligned services but some frontend pages
still used manual fetch calls and outdated pages. Pump creation on the
Pumps page bypassed the service layer and station creation routed to an
older component.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Pump creation alignment (`STEP_fix_20251218.md`)
- React Query hooks for pumps and stations exist

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `PumpsPage.tsx` to use `useCreatePump` hook instead of manual `fetch`
  so creation follows the contract based service and cache updates.
- Switched the `/dashboard/stations/new` route to the modern
  `NewStationPage` component.
