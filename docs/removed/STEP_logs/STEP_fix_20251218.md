# STEP_fix_20251218.md â€” Fix pump creation and align interfaces

## Project Context Summary
Pump creation from the Pump Settings page fails due to mismatched
backend response shape and inconsistent interfaces. The backend
returns `{ pump: {...} }` while the frontend expects a `Pump` object.
The validator also allowed optional `serialNumber` which conflicts with
the OpenAPI contract.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Station creation restored to use service layer (`STEP_fix_20251217.md`).
- Pump routes, services and hooks exist but response contract is
  inconsistent.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `pump.validator.ts` to require `serialNumber`.
- Refactored `pump.controller.ts` create handler to use
  `createPump` service and return the pump object with
  camelCase fields and `nozzleCount`.
- Synced frontend interfaces in `api-contract.ts` and
  `services/pumpsService.ts` with the backend response.
- Adjusted `pumpsApi.createPump` to extract the pump object
  correctly.
- Removed unused `src/hooks/usePumps.ts`.
