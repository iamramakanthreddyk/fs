# STEP_fix_20251221.md â€” Station, Pump, Nozzle refresh fixes

## Project Context Summary
Newly created stations, pumps, nozzles and readings were only visible after a manual page refresh. Some creation components bypassed shared React Query hooks, preventing automatic cache updates.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Pump create page refactored to use `useCreatePump` (`STEP_fix_20251220.md`)
- Stations route aligned to `NewStationPage` (`STEP_fix_20251219.md`)

## What Was Done Now
- Updated API hooks (`useStations`, `usePumps`, `useNozzles`) to invalidate all relevant queries on creation/update/delete so lists refresh automatically.
- Refactored `CreateStationDialog` to use the `useCreateStation` hook instead of a custom mutation.
- Added a short reference document `FRONTEND_API_USAGE.md` summarising API modules and their matching backend endpoints.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `fuelsync/docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/FRONTEND_API_USAGE.md`
