# STEP_fix_20251227.md — Nozzle reading backend fixes

## Project Context Summary
An audit of the nozzle readings feature revealed missing payment method data, inconsistent transaction clients and an inefficient latest reading lookup.

## Steps Already Implemented
Previous fixes up to 2025‑12‑23 aligned dashboard fields and numeric formatting.

## What Was Done Now
- Included `payment_method` when inserting nozzle readings and ensured validator defaults it to `cash` or `credit`.
- `canCreateNozzleReading` now returns `missingPrice` when no active fuel price exists.
- Volumes rounded to three decimals and single pg client used for price lookups.
- Reading list supports a `limit` parameter for efficient latest fetches.
- OpenAPI specs updated and status code corrected to 201.
