# STEP_fix_20251229_COMMAND.md

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub uses a Codex-first workflow. The previous fix aligned the frontend with backend nozzle reading APIs. During code review, an inline comment questioned whether `payment_method` exists in the database and requested a check. The database schema indeed includes this column and the backend stores the value. However, the autogenerated API contract still allowed a deprecated `digital_wallet` option which is not present in the schema or OpenAPI spec.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Backend and frontend updated to handle `paymentMethod` and latest reading query (see `STEP_fix_20251228.md`).

## What to Build Now
- Confirm database schema includes `payment_method` (verified in migrations and Prisma schema).
- Remove the outdated `digital_wallet` value from the API contract type to match OpenAPI and DB.
- Document this clarification.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`
