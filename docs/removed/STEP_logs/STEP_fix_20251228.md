# STEP_fix_20251228.md â€” Frontend nozzle reading alignment

## Project Context Summary
The backend now stores `payment_method`, flags missing fuel prices and lets the
latest reading be fetched via a `limit` parameter. The frontend still fetched all
readings and ignored the new fields.

## Steps Already Implemented
Backend fixes up to `STEP_fix_20251227.md` covered API updates and
documentation.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated reading services in `src/api` to accept a `limit` option and use it for
  fetching the latest reading.
- Hooks and pages now show volumes with three-decimal precision.
- Confirmed `paymentMethod` is sent when creating readings and surfaced
  `missingPrice` in can-create checks.
- Documentation and implementation index updated.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`
