# STEP_fix_20250722.md â€” Backend audit doc cleanup

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub backend is implemented in `/fuelsync` using Express and Prisma. A comprehensive audit in July 2025 identified remaining raw `pg` queries and missing tests. Previous fix (2025-07-21) migrated key services to Prisma and added tests.

## Steps Already Implemented
- `STEP_fix_20250721_COMMAND.md` migrated station, nozzle and fuel inventory services
- Unit tests exist for credit payments, fuel inventory and analytics

## What Was Done Now
- Fixed a leftover bug in `fuelInventory.service.ts` and ensured iteration over Prisma results
- Created missing `docs/PRISMA_EFFICIENCY_REVIEW.md`
- Updated `BACKEND_FULL_REVIEW_JUL2025.md` to mark issues resolved

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append changelog entry
- Add row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- Summarize in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
