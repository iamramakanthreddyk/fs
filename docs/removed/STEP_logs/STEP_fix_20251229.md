# STEP_fix_20251229.md â€” API contract cleanup

## Project Context Summary
Inline review comments asked whether `payment_method` existed in the database. The migrations and Prisma schema confirm it does. The backend already stores this field. The frontend API contract still offered a `digital_wallet` option which does not exist in the database or OpenAPI specification.

## Steps Already Implemented
See `STEP_fix_20251228.md` for previous frontend alignment.

## What Was Done Now
- Verified migrations `003_unified_schema.sql` and others define `payment_method` for `nozzle_readings`.
- Removed the outdated `digital_wallet` value from `src/api/api-contract.ts` so types match the backend and docs.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `fuelsync/docs/PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`
