# FuelSync Hub - Owner Flow Fix

## Issue Fixed
The owner role was unable to create pumps or nozzles due to missing implementation in the owner service.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Owner Service
Added nozzle management methods to the owner service:
- `createNozzle()`
- `updateNozzle()`
- `deleteNozzle()`

### 2. Updated Component Implementation
Modified the CreatePumpPage and CreateNozzlePage components to:
- Try using the owner service first
- Fall back to the direct API if needed
- Ensure proper error handling

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Added detailed setup flow documentation in `OWNER_SETUP_FLOW.md`
- Updated the OWNER.md journey documentation to include pump and nozzle creation
- Updated API_SPECIFICATION.md to clarify role permissions
- Updated OpenAPI specification to properly document request/response schemas

### 4. Flow Maintenance
Ensured the setup wizard flow is maintained:
1. Create Station
2. Create Pumps
3. Create Nozzles
4. Set Fuel Prices

## Testing
The changes should be tested by:
1. Logging in as an owner
2. Following the setup wizard flow
3. Verifying that pumps and nozzles can be created successfully

## Additional Notes
- The owner role now has full permissions to manage the station hierarchy
- The setup wizard properly guides owners through the setup process
- Documentation has been updated to reflect the correct flow
