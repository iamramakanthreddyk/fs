# STEP_fix_20251217.md â€” Restore createStation service

## Project Context Summary
The previous fix added a station name duplication check but removed the
`createStation` service function. This function is required for enforcing
plan limits before inserting stations. Controllers currently bypass plan
checks and write directly via Prisma.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Station name duplication handled directly in the controller
- All list endpoints return empty arrays when no data

## What Was Done Now
- Reintroduced `createStation` in `services/station.service.ts` with a
  duplicate name lookup and plan enforcement.
- Updated `station.controller.ts` to call this service instead of using
  Prisma directly.
- Documentation updated to reflect the restored service usage.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
