# STEP_fix_20260722_COMMAND.md â€” Fuel price service test coverage

Project Context Summary:
The fuel price creation logic was updated to close any open range when inserting a new price. Overlap detection relies on database constraints. No unit tests currently cover this behaviour.

Steps already implemented: fixes through `STEP_fix_20260721_COMMAND.md` including Pumps page defaults.

Task: Add a Jest test file `backend/tests/fuelPrice.service.test.ts` that mocks the database connection. Verify that attempting to create a price overlapping an existing range results in an error and that inserting a new price after an open range updates the previous record's `effective_to`.

Required documentation updates: `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/backend/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/backend/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`, `backend/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`, `backend/docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
