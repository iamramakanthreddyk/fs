# STEP_fix_20251222.md â€” Station, Pump and Nozzle edit pages

## Project Context Summary
The dashboard offers CRUD operations for stations, pumps and nozzles. Creation works with React Query hooks, but edit functionality was missing. Users could navigate to edit URLs via buttons but no pages were implemented, so updates were impossible.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Creation pages use `useCreateStation`, `useCreatePump` and `useCreateNozzle`
- Query invalidation on create/delete ensures lists refresh (`STEP_fix_20251221.md`)

## What Was Done Now
- Implemented `EditStationPage`, `EditPumpPage` and `EditNozzlePage` with forms prefilled from existing data.
- Added update logic using `useUpdateStation`, `useUpdatePump` and `useUpdateNozzle` hooks.
- Registered new routes in `App.tsx` for `/edit` paths under stations, pumps and nozzles.

## Required Documentation Updates

- `fuelsync/docs/PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`
