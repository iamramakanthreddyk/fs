# FuelSync Development Accountability Checklist

This checklist must be followed by all developers and AI agents when making changes to the FuelSync frontend codebase. It ensures consistency, maintainability, and proper documentation.

## Before Implementation

- [ ] I have read and understood the relevant documentation:
  - [ ] User journey documentation for the feature area
  - [ ] API Integration Guide for implementation patterns
  - [ ] Development Strategy for best practices

- [ ] I have checked the Documentation Map to understand code-documentation relationships

- [ ] I have analyzed the existing code to understand:
  - [ ] Data flow and state management
  - [ ] Service and hook implementations
  - [ ] Component structure and props
  - [ ] Error handling patterns

- [ ] I have created a minimal implementation plan that:
  - [ ] Follows the standardized patterns
  - [ ] Maintains backward compatibility
  - [ ] Handles errors appropriately
  - [ ] Considers edge cases

## During Implementation

- [ ] I am following the standardized API integration pattern:
  - [ ] Using the service layer for API calls
  - [ ] Using React Query hooks for data fetching
  - [ ] Implementing proper error handling
  - [ ] Adding appropriate loading states

- [ ] I am maintaining type safety:
  - [ ] Using TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
  - [ ] Avoiding `any` types
  - [ ] Using proper type guards

- [ ] I am adding proper documentation:
  - [ ] JSDoc comments with `@see` tags
  - [ ] References to relevant documentation
  - [ ] Clear descriptions of functions and components

## After Implementation

- [ ] I have tested my changes:
  - [ ] Functionality works as expected
  - [ ] Error scenarios are handled
  - [ ] No regressions in related features
  - [ ] Performance is maintained

- [ ] I have updated documentation:
  - [ ] Updated relevant documentation files
  - [ ] Added entry to FRONTEND_CHANGELOG.md
  - [ ] Updated DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md if new files were created

- [ ] I have created a summary of changes that includes:
  - [ ] What was changed and why
  - [ ] How it was implemented
  - [ ] Any potential impact on other features
  - [ ] Any known limitations or edge cases

## Final Verification

- [ ] My changes follow the API Optimization Checklist
- [ ] My changes maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] My changes are properly documented
- [ ] My changes follow the business requirements

By completing this checklist, I confirm that my changes meet the quality standards of the FuelSync frontend codebase and will be maintainable by other developers and AI agents in the future.
